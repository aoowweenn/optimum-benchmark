# Examples

This folder contains examples of config files for different models and use cases.

To use a config file you should first copy it to the [configs](../config) folder and then run [`main.py`](../main.py) with it in the `--config-path` option. 

If you have defined sweep logic in your config file, don't forget the `-m` or `--multirun` option.
